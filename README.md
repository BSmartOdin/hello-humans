How does this thing work?
You would think it's something you have been taught. Now the problem, of what if it's something New?
Frequency, is a flow, much like an uncalm waters.
Binary, can be called either on or off, while let's not forget there is transition, so 3.
Software is or could be volitile while hardware, could do the same thing without change? While flowing is for change or path.
So flow can be two, while non-flow be third?
What if we have mastered explosive outward flow, while what is needed now is implosive force, so inward?
Observation is key, to follow what is Natural, is helpful; while opposite of could be unnatural and harmful.

What if your goal was to Master Self, not to control to force, but to help or aid?
If nature is natural, transition is slow, practice make perfect, FOCUS is a first step, so practice daily, slow is a start.
How many seconds? So FOCUS is the start, WILL is the determination, so why do less? Daily? On what? Change? Natural?
